# Simulation Study for "Meta-Analysis Approaches for Evaluating Immune Correlates of Risk Using Combined Case-Cohort Biomarker Data from Diverse Assays"

This repository contains the code used for the simulation study in our paper:

> **Meta-Analysis Approaches for Evaluating Immune Correlates of Risk Using Combined Case-Cohort Biomarker Data from Diverse Assay**  
> Authors: Trevor J Thomson, Ying Huang, and Peter B. Gilbert  
> Submitted to "Statistics in Biosciences"

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides:
- Code to generate simulated data under a logistic regression model, and obtain information to reproduce Figure 3, and Tables 3 and 4

## 🛠️ Requirements
The code was written in **R** and uses the following packages:
- `MASS`
- `nleqslv`
- `mvtnorm`
- `Rcpp`
- `RcppArmadillo`
- `stringr`
- `numDeriv`
- `cubature`

The **R** script calls **C++** files to execute our proposed estimation strategy.
